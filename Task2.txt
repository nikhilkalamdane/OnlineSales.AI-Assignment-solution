Task 2 : With the same attachment, use each worksheet as a CSV file and write a script (Bash or Python) that generates the same report.
Data is to be read from the CSV files not from a database.

Solution : 
1. Here, I am pandas which is library of python which is used for working with datasets.
2. Firstly, reading all csv data using read_csv inbuilt function.
3. Then joining departments and employees table using merge function and combine with them with salaries table.
4. For final output, I am using inbuilt function such as groupby, mean, sort_values, head respectively.

import pandas as pd

departments = pd.read_csv('Departments.csv')
employees = pd.read_csv("Employees.csv")
salaries = pd.read_csv("Salaries.csv")

dept_emp = pd.merge(departments,employees, left_on='ID',right_on='DEPT_ID')

data = pd.merge(dept_emp,salaries,left_on="ID_x",right_on='EMP_ID')

# It will print data from all three tables after merging
print(data.to_string())


output = data.groupby(['NAME_x'])['AMT'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False).head(3)

# It will show final output as top 3 departments along with their name and average monthly salary
print(output.to_string())
